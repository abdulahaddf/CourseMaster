Project: Full-Featured EdTech Platform ("CourseMaster")

1. Project Overview

The purpose of this technical assessment is to evaluate your ability to design and develop a full-
featured, production-ready E-learning platform using the MERN stack. This project, titled

CourseMaster, simulates a real-world environment where modern EdTech platforms must
support thousands of students, instructors, and administrators while ensuring scalability,
performance, and reliability.
You are required to build the core functional modules of an E-learning system where:
● Students can browse, purchase, and consume courses.
● Administrators can manage courses, track enrollments, and review assignments.
● The platform supports secure authentication, efficient APIs, and a structured database
design.
The objective is not just to “make it work,” but to demonstrate that you can build a clean,
maintainable, and scalable system with production-ready architecture.
2. Technology Stack (Mandatory)
● Frontend: Next.js (Pages or App Router) or React.js.
● Backend: Node.js with Express.js.
● Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM.
● State Management: Redux (Toolkit preferred) or Context API.
3. Key Functional Requirements
A. Authentication & Authorization
● Student: Registration, Login, and Logout (JWT Authentication).

● Admin: distinct login (can be a hardcoded seeder or a specific registration key).
● Security: Passwords must be hashed (bcrypt). Protect private routes (e.g., Dashboard).
B. Public Pages (Unprotected)
1. Home/Course Listing:
○ Display available courses.
○ Advanced Features: Implement Server-Side Pagination, Searching (by
title/instructor), Sorting (Price: Low/High), and Filtering (Category/Tags).

2. Course Details:
○ Detailed view of a course (Title, Description, Instructor, Syllabus, Price).
○ "Enroll Now" button (If logged in -> Payment/Enroll; If guest -> Redirect to Login).

C. Student Features (Protected)
1. Student Dashboard:
○ View list of enrolled courses.
○ Progress tracking (e.g., "40% Completed").
2. Course Consumption:
○ Watch video lectures (can use embedded YouTube/Vimeo links for simplicity).
○ Mark as Completed: A button to mark a specific lesson as done, updating the
progress bar.
3. Assignments & Quizzes:
○ Assignment: An input field to submit a Google Drive link or text answer for a
specific module.
○ Quiz: A multiple-choice quiz interface for a specific module. The score is
displayed immediately upon submission.

D. Admin Features (Protected)
1. Course Management:
○ Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) courses.
○ Define "Batches" for courses (e.g., Batch 1 starts Jan 1st).
2. Enrollment Management:
○ View all students enrolled in a specific course or batch.
3. Assignment Review:
○ View submitted assignments from students.

4. Technical & Non-Functional Requirements
Database & Performance

1. Schema Design: Use Mongoose relationships/references properly (e.g., linking
Courses to Users for enrollment).
2. Optimization:
○ Implement database indexing for search fields.
○ Prevent the N+1 problem when fetching course data.
○ Use caching where applicable (optional but recommended).

Code Quality
1. Error Handling: Proper try/catch blocks and a global error handling middleware in
Express.
2. Validation: Use Joi or Zod for input validation (API side).
3. Clean Code: Modular file structure (Controllers, Routes, Services, Models).
5. Bonus Challenge (To Stand Out)
Implement one of the following to earn extra credit:
1. Redis Integration: Cache the "All Courses" API response to reduce database load.
2. Analytics Dashboard: An admin chart showing enrollments over time (use Recharts or
Chart.js).
3. Email Notification: Send a welcome email upon registration (using Nodemailer).
